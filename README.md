# My Awesome Project
For this project I made a carousel web application. This web application flips through album art.

## How It's Made:

I made this web application with both JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The user can click the buttons "next" or "last" to flip the the next picture in the carousel or the picture before the current picture. I used CSS to make the body of the page black.


## Lessons Learned:

While making this web application I learned how to properly make arrays and cipher through its contents.
